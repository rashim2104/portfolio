  about: <>Hey there! I'm Rashim â€” a techie, a builder, and the guy who somehow ends up leading the team when things get serious ðŸ˜…
    <br /><br />
    Currently surviving 3rd-year IT and thriving on code, caffeine, and deadlines. From QR-based tracking systems to event platforms like Eventify, I've built stuff that actually works (and doesn't crash at the wrong time ðŸ’€).
    <br /><br />
    I'm interning at <a href="https://www.skcript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skcript</a>, where we build stuffs, that is cool. Won an IEEE SIGHT Fund for innovative tech solutions, and led the tech team for TEDxSriSairamIT. Basically, I break things till they work.
    <br /><br />
    Let's build something cool?
