"1:26 AM, running on caffeine and adrenaline—this was more than just an event; it was a test of grit."

From sleepless nights to high-pressure problem-solving, TEDxSriSairamIT was an experience like no other. As part of the technical team, our role wasn't just behind-the-scenes—it was the backbone of the event.

## Technical Achievements
✅ Built the official event website 🌐
✅ Managed online ticketing 🎟️
✅ Handled the entire tech setup—including a last-minute livestream challenge for people who missed out the tickets

## The Livestream Challenge
The real test? Livestreaming an entire event with zero prior experience. I had never worked with cameras before, never set up a broadcast—but there I was, figuring it out in real-time. 30 minutes of trial and error, a tangle of wires, and a race against the clock—and then, finally, a seamless stream for everyone who couldn't get a ticket.

## Memorable Connections
But the event wasn't just about solving technical challenges. It was also about connections and conversations. One of the most exciting moments? Meeting Mr. Magizhan Selvan, CEO of Namma Yatri—our discussion about the future of mobility in Chennai left me inspired. Something big is on the way, and it's going to change how the city moves. Stay tuned. 🚦🚆

## Behind the Scenes
Swipe through the pictures—1:26 AM grind, 6 AM stage setup, and the livestream in action. This was more than just an event. It was a challenge, a rush, and a reminder that sometimes, you learn the most when you're thrown into the deep end.
