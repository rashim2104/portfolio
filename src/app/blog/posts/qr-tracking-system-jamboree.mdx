üöÄ What if you could manage the movement of thousands of attendees seamlessly while ensuring no venue was overcrowded? That's exactly what our team accomplished at the Bharath Scouts and Guides Diamond Jubilee Jamboree held in Trichy, which saw an impressive footfall of 15,000+ attendees.

I'm excited to share the incredible journey of developing a cutting-edge QR-based tracking system for the Global Development Village (GDV), organized by Sairam Institutions. While the Jamboree itself was a grand celebration, our focus was on creating a solution that ensured smooth operations and efficient venue management within the GDV. üåü

## The Solution
üí° Initially, the requirement was simple: a system with red/green buttons to block and unblock venues based on capacity. However, we expanded it into a dynamic QR-based solution, where each patrol was assigned a unique QR code. These codes were scanned across 14 zones, automatically blocking venues once capacity was reached. Scanners could also unblock venues, ensuring seamless operations throughout.

## Challenges and Timeline
üõ†Ô∏è We had just 5 days from January 22, 2025 to conceptualize, build, and test the system. Despite sleepless nights, everything ran smoothly when the Jamboree began on January 28, 2025, and continued flawlessly until February 3, 2025.
